## Question

Is there a correlation between the frequency of how often someone reviews on Yelp and the amount they travel? If so, do more frequent reviewers travel more than non-frequent reviewers based off of the cities and coordinates they review at?

Why is this interesting? 

- It could be helpful for organizational purposes on Yelp. If more frequent users travel more, maybe they could make recommendations of organizations for users to visit when they travel.
