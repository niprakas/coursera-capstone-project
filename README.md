# coursera-capstone-project
This is the final project in the data science specialization for the John Hopkin's Specialization class on Coursera.
Note: in order for most of the code to work, one must first download the data and then extract the data from the zipped folder. Also, not all of the data has been pushed to this repository.

You can get the yelp dataset zip file from this link:
